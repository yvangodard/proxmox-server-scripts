# proxmox-server-scripts
Various scripts for configuring and administering a Proxmox (Debian) server and VMs

#### Backup and Restore with S3QL

 - s3ql: an init script for mounting the s3ql encryped filesystem for use as a storage directory in Proxmox
 - s3ql_backup.sh: for backing up a whole Proxmox server with s3ql to Amazon S3 storage
 - s3ql_restore.sh:	for restoring a whole Proxmox server with 3sql from Amazon S3 storage

#### Networking in KVM Guests
 - setup_network.sh: for changing static network settings in Debian guest VM after cloning

#### Automatically remove Proxmox “No Valid Subscription” message on upgrades

The Proxmox “No Valid Subscription” message re-appears after each Proxmox software update, even if you initially patched the pve-manager file. Since Proxmox is free software under the GPL, I do not like the connotation of the message, which makes it sound like one is using unlicenced software. If you want to use the community repository for updates and do not need commercial support, it is completely legitimate to run Proxmox this way. If you want to use the 'enterprise repository', please look into the attractive [subscription options](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/pricing).

Check your /etc/apt/sources.list and make sure, that you are actually getting updates from the free [Proxmox repository](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Package_repositories):

```
echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian wheezy pve-no-subscription" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
```

 - proxmox_noreminder.sh: the script automatically removes the Proxmox 3.4 “No Valid Subscription” message on upgrades by watching the relevant directory with ```incron```. Incron is watching the directory, as it seems to trigger more reliably than watching only the file. A few files in this directory are replaced during each upgrade, but only one needs to be patched in this edition of Proxmox. The script also patches the Proxmox Support Tab with a more friendly message.

Initially backup & patch the files manually and confirm with diff, that the changes are as expected:
```
cp /usr/share/pve-manager/ext6/pvemanagerlib.js /usr/share/pve-manager/ext6/pvemanagerlib.js.bak
sed -i -r -e "s/if \(data.status !== 'Active'\) \{/if (false) {/" /usr/share/pve-manager/ext6/pvemanagerlib.js 
sed -i -r -e "s/You do not have a valid subscription for this server/This server is receiving updates from the Proxmox VE No-Subscription Repository/" /usr/share/pve-manager/ext6/pvemanagerlib.js 
sed -i -r -e "s/No valid subscription/Community Edition/" /usr/share/pve-manager/ext6/pvemanagerlib.js

diff /usr/share/pve-manager/ext6/pvemanagerlib.js.bak /usr/share/pve-manager/ext6/pvemanagerlib.js
```

Install Incron and only allow the root user
```
apt-get install incron
echo "root" >> /etc/incron.allow
```

and copy the script:
```
mkdir -v /etc/incron.scripts
cp proxmox_noreminder.sh /etc/incron.scripts/proxmox_noreminder.sh
chmod +x /etc/incron.scripts/proxmox_noreminder.sh
```

Add the following in incrontab
```
incrontab -e
...
/usr/share/pve-manager/ext6/ IN_CREATE /etc/incron.scripts/proxmox_noreminder.sh $#
```

Test with (in another terminal):
```
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep incrond
tail -n 30 -f /var/log/incron.log
```
Reinstalling pve-manager should trigger incron:
```
apt-get install --reinstall pve-manager
```
